## üìù Reflection

During the development of the WeatherWise project, I reflected on my learning process and growth in several areas:

1. **Technical Skills**
   - I improved my Python programming skills, particularly in modular design and function implementation.
   - Working with APIs and processing JSON data enhanced my understanding of real-world data handling.
   - Creating data visualisations reinforced my ability to present information clearly.

2. **AI Interaction & Prompting**
   - I learned how to communicate effectively with AI tools, refining prompts to get more accurate and useful outputs.
   - Documenting the before/after AI responses helped me critically evaluate code suggestions and improve them.
   - Understanding edge cases and asking for iterative improvements strengthened my problem-solving skills.

3. **Project Management**
   - Using GitHub for version control taught me the importance of incremental commits and clear documentation.
   - Planning notebook structure and separating concerns improved the readability and maintainability of my code.

4. **Personal Growth**
   - I became more patient and methodical when troubleshooting errors and debugging code.
   - I learned the value of persistence and iterative improvement, especially when AI-generated suggestions were not immediately perfect.

**Next Steps**
- Continue practising intentional AI prompting to increase efficiency in problem-solving.
- Explore additional data sources for richer weather insights.
- Improve the user interface based on feedback and testing.

In conclusion, this project allowed me to integrate multiple skills‚Äîprogramming, data analysis, AI interaction, and documentation‚Äîinto a cohesive application. I feel more confident in my ability to tackle complex problems and to leverage AI effectively in real-world projects.
