## AI Tools Used
The most significant obstacle was the challenge of transitioning from basic classroom theory to advanced, practical application. Using APIs and interacting with AI tools, while figuring out their error handling within my AI functions, was demanding, and tracking down bugs consumed a significant amount of my development time. However, this process turned into a critical learning opportunity, allowing me to acquire high-level programming skills, particularly in developing API call functions that adhere to professional standards to ensure stability.
I used ChatGPT and Copilot as my main AI tools during this project. These tools helped me debug errors, improve code structure, and learn how to handle issues efficiently within my functions.

## Prompting Techniques
The project fundamentally changed how I view and use Generative AI for improving efficiency. I learned to treat AI applications as a helpful and strategic partner for handling the most demanding aspects of the implementation. I utilised the LLMs to make specific changes and clean up my code structure. The intentional use of AI helped me solve problems much faster and resulted in higher code quality. This strategic partnership ultimately enhanced the final product and saved me a significant amount of time.
Through this experience, I applied intentional prompting strategies by providing clear, structured context and asking AI tools to refine or explain the logic rather than give answers.

## What Worked Well?
I am proud that I overcame the challenge of interacting with API and AI tools, which initially seemed overwhelming. The process of completing and observing code functions gave me ultimate proof of the efficiency and essential nature of these advanced programming techniques in IT. This achievement became a turning point in my confidence with practical coding and debugging.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would improve the modularity of the code and include more testing scenarios to ensure full stability and reliability. I would also like to refine further the error management functions and the structure of AI-assisted code to make the implementation cleaner and easier to maintain

## Final Thoughts
As I opened the WeatherWise project, it was my first real coding challenge using Python. The required skills felt much harder than the basic concepts we covered in class, which meant I had to push myself and dedicate a significant amount of time to the project.
In conclusion, this demanding project leads to the development of practical skills using Python. The experience highlighted the essential requirement for continuous practice to achieve effectiveness in programming functions and features. The insights gained from advanced challenges, particularly the implementation of external APIs and error management, are recognised as the essential foundation for our future in the field of information systems and technology development.
