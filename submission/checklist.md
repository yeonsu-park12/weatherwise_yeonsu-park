Use this checklist to track your progress and ensure your Weather Advisor project meets all requirements before submission.

## Repository Setup

- [ ] Repository created from template
- [ ] README.md updated with your project information
- [ ] Instructor (michael-borck) invited to your repository

## Notebook Organisation

- [ ] Notebook has clear section headers using markdown cells
- [ ] Sections are logically organised and follow the required structure
- [ ] Code includes appropriate comments and docstrings
- [ ] No unused code or unnecessary cells
- [ ] All imports are at the top of the notebook or in the appropriate section

## Weather Data Component

- [ ] Successfully retrieves weather data from chosen source
- [ ] Handles connection errors and timeouts gracefully
- [ ] Validates user input (e.g., city names, parameters)
- [ ] Processes and structures the data for use in the application
- [ ] Provides meaningful error messages for users

## Visualisation Component

- [ ] Implements at least 2 different visualisation types
- [ ] All visualisations have proper titles, labels, and legends
- [ ] Visualisations are readable and use appropriate colors
- [ ] Handles edge cases (e.g., missing data, extreme values)
- [ ] Visualisations are relevant to the data being displayed

## Natural Language Interface

- [ ] Successfully parses user questions to extract key information
- [ ] Identifies locations in user queries
- [ ] Identifies time periods in user queries (today, tomorrow, etc.)
- [ ] Identifies weather attributes (temperature, rain, etc.)
- [ ] Generates natural-sounding responses to user questions

## User Interface

- [ ] Implements a clear menu system using pyinputplus
- [ ] Provides appropriate feedback to users
- [ ] Has a logical flow between different options
- [ ] Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- [ ] Maintains a clean and organised display

## AI Interaction Documentation

- [ ] PROMPTING.md file completed with detailed examples
- [ ] At least 5 significant AI conversations documented
- [ ] Conversations saved as text files in the repository
- [ ] Demonstrates at least 5 different intentional prompting techniques
- [ ] Six-step methodology documented for at least one component
- [ ] 3 clear before/after examples included

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] All code runs without errors in Google Colab
- [ ] No hardcoded sensitive data (API keys, personal information)
- [ ] Modular design with functions for specific tasks
- [ ] Appropriate error handling throughout the application
- [ ] Code follows consistent style (variable naming, indentation, etc.)

## Final Testing

- [ ] Tested with multiple locations
- [ ] Tested with various types of weather questions
- [ ] Tested with edge cases (invalid locations, connection issues)
- [ ] All menu options function as expected
- [ ] Visualisations render correctly

## Documentation Quality

- [ ] Code is well-commented with meaningful docstrings
- [ ] README.md provides clear overview and instructions
- [ ] PROMPTING.md shows thoughtful AI interaction
- [ ] Reflection document (300-500 words) included
- [ ] All required files are present and properly formatted

## Submission

- [ ] Final version of notebook saved to GitHub
- [ ] All AI conversation files included
- [ ] PROMPTING.md file completed
- [ ] Reflection document included
- [ ] Repository link submitted through required channel

## Extra Credit (Optional)

- [ ] Implemented additional features beyond basic requirements
- [ ] Created especially innovative visualisations
- [ ] Developed advanced natural language understanding capabilities
- [ ] Demonstrated exceptional intentional prompting techniques
- [ ] Utilised the hands-on-ai package in creative ways
