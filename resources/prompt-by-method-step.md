This guide provides targeted prompts for each of the six programming foundations from the handout. Each section includes:

- üéØ Concept Exploration Prompts: For understanding the concept
- üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Prompts: For applying the concept
- üîç Debugging Prompts: For fixing issues
- üöÄ Challenge Prompts: For extending your learning

> **Important Note to Students**: This document demonstrates the *approach* to intentional prompting, not specific prompts to copy. Your project will have unique requirements and challenges that will require your own thoughtful prompts. Simply copying these example prompts will not result in the best solution for your specific implementation, and will not demonstrate your personal understanding and engagement with the AI. The assessment focuses on your ability to craft effective prompts specific to your project's needs - not on reproducing this example. Use this as inspiration for your own authentic conversations with AI, where you identify problems, ask clarifying questions, challenge initial solutions, and guide the AI toward better outcomes for your particular implementation.
