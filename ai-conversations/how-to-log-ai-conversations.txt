📂 AI Conversation Folder Instructions

This folder is where you save your AI interactions used during development.

🗂️ What to include:
- At least 5 significant AI conversations
- Each as a separate .txt file (e.g. conversation1.txt, conversation2.txt, etc.)
- Each file should include:
   - A short header at the top:
     - Tool used (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
     - Date of the conversation

💬 Conversation Example Format:

----------------------------------
Tool: ChatGPT
Date: 2025-04-15
----------------------------------

Me: How do I parse temperature from this weather JSON?
AI: You can use `weather["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"]` to get the temperature.

Me: What if it’s missing?
AI: Add error handling using `try/except`...

(continue until the conversation ends)

📌 No special formatting required.
Just copy the entire conversation text and paste it here.

⚠️ Warning:
Use the `.txt` format, **not screenshots or PDFs**. AI logs should be searchable and lightweight.
