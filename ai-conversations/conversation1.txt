Me: I need to choose a real-time weather data source for the WeatherWise project. I have three options: 1) using an existing Python package, 2) directly using wttr.in’s JSON API, or 3) OpenWeatherMap with an API key. I want to show both custom data parsing and API interaction skills. Which option would best satisfy the core requirements and maybe earn some bonus points?

AI: Let’s break this down carefully.

Option 1, using a pre-built package, is the easiest but it doesn’t really show custom API interaction. This might not meet your core learning objectives.

Option 3, OpenWeatherMap, offers structured and detailed data, which could make your data processing more complex—but it requires API key management and introduces potential security and workflow issues.

Option 2, wttr.in JSON API (?format=j1), doesn’t require a key and is easy to set up. The JSON structure is nested and slightly complex, which means you need to write Python logic for custom parsing. This directly demonstrates your ability to handle nested data and API requests, which aligns perfectly with the learning goals.

Me: Got it. So choosing wttr.in allows me to avoid key management and focus on custom requests and nested JSON parsing. Can you walk me through how nested it is? For example, how deep do I need to go to get current temperature or wind speed?

AI: Sure. The wttr.in JSON structure is ideal for this exercise. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Current temperature: current_condition[0]['temp_C'] (one level of list containing a dictionary)

Weather description: current_condition[0]['weatherDesc'][0]['value'] (two levels of list/dict)

Daily maximum temperature: weather[i]['maxtempC'] (daily list of dictionaries)

Hourly wind speed: weather[i]['hourly'][j]['windspeedKmph'] (three levels deep, most nested)

Because of this structure, after calling get_weather_data(), you will likely need complex list comprehensions or nested loops to extract the needed information.

Me: Perfect. Now let’s define the I/O contract for the core function get_weather_data(location: str). I want it to return a consistent Python dictionary in all cases—success, network error, or 404. That way, the main application flow can standardize error checking. Success should return the original JSON, and failure should return a standardized error dictionary.

AI: Excellent. Returning a consistent dictionary lets higher-level functions like run_app avoid None checks and just verify an error key. Here’s the contract we can define:

Input:

location (str)

timeout (int, default 10s)

Success Output:

{"current_condition": [...], "weather": [...]}


Failure Output:

{"error": status_code, "message": "error description"}


Me: Great. Let’s write the pseudocode for the function using requests. We’ll handle success, basic HTTP errors, and network errors—but we can skip retry logic for now.

AI: Here’s a core flow pseudocode:

function get_weather_data(location):
    construct wttr.in URL with location
    try:
        send HTTP GET request with timeout
        raise exception if HTTP status is 4xx or 5xx
        parse JSON and return
    except HTTPError:
        return {"error": status_code, "message": reason}
    except NetworkError:
        return {"error": 503, "message": network issue description}
    except OtherError:
        return {"error": 500, "message": unexpected error}


Me: Looks good. Now, for the Python implementation, I want to handle all request-related exceptions in one place using requests.exceptions.RequestException. response.raise_for_status() will explicitly catch HTTP errors.

AI: Here’s a solid first version:

import requests
from requests.exceptions import RequestException
from typing import Dict

def get_weather_data(location: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Retrieves raw weather data for a specified location from wttr.in.
    Returns a dictionary: data on success, error details on failure.
    """
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    
    except RequestException as e:
        if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response is not None:
            status_code = e.response.status_code
            print(f"⚠️ HTTP Error {status_code}: {e.response.reason}")
            return {"error": status_code, "message": f"Server returned error: {e.response.reason}"}
        else:
            print(f"❌ Network Error: {type(e).__name__} occurred.")
            return {"error": 503, "message": f"Network issue: {type(e).__name__}."}
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected Error: {type(e).__name__}")
        return {"error": 500, "message": "An unexpected error occurred."}


Me: I really like how you separated HTTP errors from pure network errors using hasattr(e, 'response'). This makes the function robust and predictable.

AI: Exactly. This initial implementation sets us up nicely for building higher-level utility functions, logging, or retry logic later. You can now focus on parsing nested data for your application logic without worrying about inconsistent responses.

Me: Yeah, and in the next phase, I can write helper functions that extract temperature, wind speed, or daily highs using list comprehensions, knowing that the base function always returns a dictionary.

AI: Right. By defining the I/O contract clearly and handling exceptions robustly, you make downstream processing much safer and cleaner.

Me: Perfect. This gives me confidence to proceed to the LLM utility functions and data processing layers. I can also demonstrate thoughtful design decisions, not just raw coding.

AI: Exactly. Your approach shows reasoning, research, and practical coding. You’re not just copying API calls—you’re thinking like a developer, which aligns with the learning objectives and will likely impress reviewers.

Me: Great. I’ll keep the pseudocode, contract, and initial Python implementation as the “Phase 1: Data Acquisition Layer” documentation. It’s a strong foundation.

AI: Agreed. This conversation fully covers your technical reasoning, API choice, exception handling strategy, and prepares you for the next development steps.

Me: Awesome. Let’s move on to implementing the utility functions next.

AI: Sounds good. You already have a clean foundation for robust weather data handling.

Me: One thing I’m thinking about—wttr.in returns deeply nested JSON. How can I make my parsing code both readable and maintainable without making a huge mess of nested loops?

AI: That’s a great question. You can consider using helper functions that take a JSON path as input and safely return a value, or use Python’s list comprehensions with get to avoid KeyErrors. Breaking your parsing logic into small reusable functions increases clarity and testability.

Me: Can you give me an example of a safe extraction function for nested data?

AI: Sure. Something like:

def safe_get(d, keys, default=None):
    for key in keys:
        if isinstance(d, list):
            if len(d) > key:
                d = d[key]
            else:
                return default
        elif isinstance(d, dict):
            d = d.get(key, default)
        else:
            return default
    return d


Then you could call:

temp = safe_get(json_data, ['current_condition', 0, 'temp_C'])


This avoids try/except everywhere, keeps parsing concise, and clearly documents which path you’re traversing.

Me: Nice. And for hourly wind speeds which are three levels deep, I can just pass the corresponding keys list, right?

AI: Exactly. You can also combine this with list comprehensions if you need to extract multiple hours or days.

Me: I’m also considering how to handle optional fields. Sometimes the API might not return certain descriptions. Should I just default to empty strings or None?

AI: Yes, a sensible default is important. You can set default="" for string fields or None for numerical fields. Using the safe_get function makes this trivial.

Me: Okay, makes sense. Regarding testing, how should I validate that get_weather_data handles all edge cases correctly?

AI: For robust testing, simulate multiple scenarios:

Normal response: valid JSON returned.

HTTP errors: mock 404 or 500 responses.

Network errors: simulate timeout or DNS failure.

Malformed JSON: occasionally corrupt a line to see if exceptions are caught.

Each test asserts that the function returns either the expected data dictionary or the standardized error dictionary.

Me: I like that. This approach lets me confidently call downstream functions like parse_weather_data knowing the input is always consistent.

AI: Exactly. That’s key to building modular and maintainable applications. Downstream logic can assume input validity and focus on data transformation or visualization.

Me: Another question: should I log errors, or is returning the error dictionary sufficient?

AI: Logging is recommended, especially for production or collaborative projects. You can use Python’s logging module. It allows you to differentiate levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and retain historical logs for debugging.

Me: Good point. I’ll add that in Phase 2. Finally, I want to ensure my development process is research-driven, not just code-writing. How can I document my decisions professionally?

AI: Include rationale for each choice:

Why you chose wttr.in over other sources.

How you handle nested JSON parsing.

Error handling strategies and standardized output.

Plans for modularity and maintainability.

This shows reviewers you understand not just “how” but also “why”—demonstrating deeper engineering thinking.

Me: Perfect. With this, I feel ready to finalize Phase 1: I/O contract, robust get_weather_data, safe parsing strategy, and clear documentation for later layers.

AI: That’s excellent. This conversation now reflects thorough research, careful design, and professional coding decisions—exactly what a strong development log should demonstrate.

Success Output:

{"current_condition": [...], "weather": [...]}


Failure Output:

{"error": status_code, "message": "error description"}


Me: Great. Before coding, I also want to make sure our function is type-safe and modular. Should I use type hints like Dict[str, Any]?

AI: Absolutely. Using type hints like Dict[str, Any] or Optional[Dict[str, Any]] improves readability, helps IDEs give better autocompletion, and makes the function clearer for team members. It’s especially important when returning either raw JSON or an error dictionary.

Me: Makes sense. Can we also incorporate some lightweight testing? For example, simple assertions or a mock call to ensure the function returns a dictionary.

AI: Definitely. You can write a small test script:

result = get_weather_data("London")
assert isinstance(result, dict), "Function should always return a dictionary"
assert "error" not in result or "current_condition" in result, "Dictionary must contain expected keys"


This lets you validate success and failure paths quickly without a full testing framework yet.

Me: Excellent. Now let’s write the pseudocode for the function using requests, handling success, basic HTTP errors, and network errors.

AI: Here’s a core flow pseudocode:

function get_weather_data(location):
    construct wttr.in URL with location
    try:
        send HTTP GET request with timeout
        raise exception if HTTP status is 4xx or 5xx
        parse JSON and return
    except HTTPError:
        return {"error": status_code, "message": reason}
    except NetworkError:
        return {"error": 503, "message": network issue description}
    except OtherError:
        return {"error": 500, "message": unexpected error}


Me: Looks good. Can we also think about reusable helper functions? For example, safe_get(dict, keys, default) to extract nested values safely.

AI: Great idea. This encourages reusability and makes parse_weather_data or future utility functions much cleaner. You can implement something like:

def safe_get(d: Dict, keys: list, default=None):
    for key in keys:
        try:
            d = d[key]
        except (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError):
            return default
    return d


Me: That will simplify nested value extraction a lot. For logging, should I use print or logging?

AI: For development, print is fine. But for a robust application, using Python’s logging module is recommended. You can set different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and later redirect logs to a file for auditing.

Me: Perfect. Let’s implement the Python function now with all these considerations.

AI: Here’s a first implementation:

import requests
from requests.exceptions import RequestException
from typing import Dict, Any

def get_weather_data(location: str, timeout: int = 10) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Retrieves raw weather data from wttr.in.
    Returns a dictionary: data on success, error details on failure.
    """
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=timeout)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    except RequestException as e:
        if hasattr(e, 'response') and e.response is not None:
            status_code = e.response.status_code
            return {"error": status_code, "message": f"Server returned error: {e.response.reason}"}
        else:
            return {"error": 503, "message": f"Network issue: {type(e).__name__}"}

    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": 500, "message": f"Unexpected error: {type(e).__name__}"}


Me: I like how HTTP errors and network errors are separated. Also, type hints, modular design, and safe extraction utilities make the code robust.

AI: Exactly. This foundation allows you to safely build helper functions for parsing temperature, wind speed, or daily highs. You can also easily swap the API later if needed, thanks to the consistent I/O contract.

Me: Should I include a small JSON sample in the documentation so anyone reading the code can understand the nested structure?

AI: Definitely. Even a 2–3 level snippet showing current_condition and weather will help developers understand how to use safe_get and the main function.

Me: Perfect. I feel confident moving to Phase 2: LLM utility functions and data processing layers.

AI: Agreed. This conversation now documents your research, design decisions, pseudocode-to-code translation, exception handling, type safety, and extensibility considerations. It shows a strong development mindset.


Me: Awesome. Let’s proceed to building robust LLM utilities next.
