Me: I want our LLM to act not just as a passive weather summarizer but as a personalised advisory system. How should we structure the system prompt to enforce that?

AI: We should define a clear persona, grounding rules, and response constraints. This way, the LLM can consistently provide actionable advice rather than generic summaries. For example, the system prompt could include: professional persona, base responses only on structured data, concise natural language, and strict English output.

Me: That makes sense. Letâ€™s draft an initial system prompt for generate_weather_response.

AI: Sure. Here's a draft:

You are a friendly and helpful WeatherWise advisor named Granite. 
Your primary goal is to analyse the provided weather data and the user's full question. 
Adhere to these rules:
1. Persona: Respond as a professional, friendly advisor.
2. Grounding: Base your analysis ONLY on the provided [Location], [Current Conditions], and [Forecast Summary].
3. Format: Provide a concise, natural language response based ONLY on the provided data.
4. Language: Respond entirely in English.


Me: Great, but this is still general. We want the AI to make consistent, actionable decisions based on real-world thresholds like wind speed and temperature. How do we inject that domain knowledge?

AI: You can embed explicit if-then rules into an Operational Guidelines section. For instance:

High-risk rule: If wind speed > 30 km/h, always advise safety precautions.

Low-risk rule: If temperature is between 18â€“28Â°C and wind speed < 15 km/h, always encourage outdoor activities.

This ensures deterministic outputs for critical scenarios.

Me: Excellent. By adding this, the LLM wonâ€™t just summarize weather; it will make decisions aligned with domain rules. How should we reflect these rules in the system prompt?

AI: Insert them under a clear [Operational Guidelines] header in the system prompt. The LLM will then prioritize these rules before generating any natural language advice. This bridges knowledge grounding and decision-making determinism.

Me: Moving on to the user side, when passing weather data to the LLM, should we include the entire JSON?

AI: Not recommended. Raw weather JSON is often hundreds of tokens long and contains extraneous data like sunrise/sunset times, wind directions per hour, etc. Feeding the full JSON increases token usage, cost, and may confuse the LLM.

Me: So we should summarize key metrics. What would be an optimal forecast_summary?

AI: Extract the min/max temperatures and a representative weather description for each day, ideally the mid-day forecast. This preserves relevant context, minimizes noise, and reduces tokens. Example:

Forecasts:
 - 2025-10-20: Min 12Â°C, Max 22Â°C. Weather: Partly cloudy
 - 2025-10-21: Min 13Â°C, Max 21Â°C. Weather: Light rain
 - 2025-10-22: Min 14Â°C, Max 23Â°C. Weather: Sunny


Me: Perfect. This gives the LLM just enough information to make actionable advice. How should the final generate_weather_response function combine the system and user prompts?

AI: Structure it as follows:

Extract key metrics from weather_data (nearest city, current conditions, forecast summary).

Define system prompt with persona and operational rules.

Define user prompt with structured, labeled data.

Send both prompts as messages to ask_ollama.

This ensures grounding, efficiency, and clarity.

Me: Can you explain why summarizing to min/max temps and description is critical for both efficiency and grounding?

AI: Sure. There are three key reasons:

Token efficiency: Full JSON may contain hundreds of unnecessary tokens; summarizing reduces LLM cost.

Noise reduction: Extraneous data like hourly wind directions could distract the LLM.

Accurate grounding: The forecast_summary directly anchors LLM reasoning to the most relevant, user-impactful information.

Me: Makes sense. Should we also consider fallback responses if weather_data is missing or incomplete?

AI: Absolutely. Implement an early check at the start of generate_weather_response:

if not weather_data:
    return "Sorry, I couldn't get the latest weather information..."


This prevents errors and ensures user-facing reliability.

Me: What about edge cases, like partially missing hourly data or unexpected JSON structure changes?

AI: Best practice is to wrap extraction in safe dictionary access (dict.get) and possibly provide defaults. For example, day.get('hourly', []) prevents KeyError. This ensures resilience against minor API changes.

Me: Let's discuss the final Python function structure. Can you outline it as a conversation?

AI: Sure. Here's a detailed walkthrough:

Me: Step one, extract the key metrics.

AI: Right. Get the city name, current temperature, and current description from weather_data['nearest_area'] and weather_data['current_condition'].

Me: Step two, build a clean forecast_summary.

AI: Loop over the next three days of weather, take min/max temps, and pick a representative description, typically mid-day. Concatenate them into a human-readable summary.

Me: Step three, define the system prompt including persona and operational guidelines.

AI: Exactly. Ensure the high-risk and low-risk domain rules are explicitly stated, so the LLM prioritizes them.

Me: Step four, define the structured user prompt.

AI: Include labeled data sections: [Location], [Current Conditions], [Forecast Summary (Next 3 Days)], and [User's Full Question].

Me: Step five, send both prompts to ask_ollama.

AI: Yes. The LLM now has all the information it needs to provide personalized, actionable advice, grounded in domain knowledge, and with minimized token usage.

Me: Finally, handle missing data gracefully and return the AI response.

AI: Correct. That ensures robust behavior even if the API fails or data is incomplete.

Me: Excellent. This structure satisfies all goals: persona-driven advisory, deterministic high/low-risk rules, efficient and grounded input, and robust handling of edge cases.

AI: Exactly. By combining strict prompt engineering, domain knowledge injection, and summarized structured input, generate_weather_response transforms the LLM from a passive summarizer into a reliable, actionable weather advisor.

Me: I think this fully demonstrates the research depth and the iterative decision-making process we took to maximize LLM value.

AI: Agreed. Itâ€™s a comprehensive blueprint showing how to turn raw weather data into consistent, actionable insights, all while keeping prompts efficient, grounded, and domain-informed.

This conversation is now long, detailed, research-oriented, and fully shows the step-by-step reasoning from persona definition to final function.

Me: I want our LLM to do more than just summarize weather data. It should act as a personalized, actionable advisor. How can we start formalizing this?

AI: We can start by defining a system prompt that sets the persona, grounding, and output constraints. Essentially, the AI should respond professionally, base decisions solely on provided data, and give concise, actionable advice in English.

Me: Okay, hereâ€™s a draft system prompt I have in mind:

system_prompt = """
You are a friendly and helpful WeatherWise advisor named Granite. 
Your primary goal is to analyze the provided weather data and user's full question. 
Adhere to these rules:
1. Persona: Respond as a professional, friendly advisor.
2. Grounding: Base your analysis ONLY on the provided [Location], [Current Conditions], and [Forecast Summary].
3. Format: Provide a concise, natural language response based ONLY on the provided data.
4. Language: Respond entirely in English.
"""


Me: This sets general behavior, but how do we ensure consistent, deterministic advice in specific situations, like high winds or extreme temperatures?

AI: We can inject explicit domain knowledge as operational guidelines. For example:

High-risk rule: Wind > 30 km/h â†’ Must advise safety/precaution.

Low-risk rule: Temp 18â€“28Â°C and wind < 15 km/h â†’ Must advise outdoor activities.

Adding these rules into the system prompt ensures LLM outputs remain consistent.

Me: Great. So the AI will use these rules whenever relevant. For the final function, we should also structure the user prompt for clarity.

AI: Exactly. The user prompt should inject structured data points, so the AI can quickly identify min/max temperatures, weather descriptions, and the userâ€™s question. Example template:

user_prompt = f"""
[Location]: {city}
[Current Conditions]: {current_temp}Â°C, {current_desc}
[Forecast Summary (Next 3 Days)]:
{forecast_summary}
User's Full Question: {parsed_question.get('question', 'What is the weather like?')}
"""


Me: Why summarize forecast data instead of sending the full JSON?

AI: Three main reasons:

Token efficiency: Original JSON could be hundreds of tokens, which is costly.

Noise reduction: LLM can get distracted by irrelevant fields like wind direction or sunrise/sunset.

Grounding accuracy: Summarized data (min/max temps, key descriptions) forces the LLM to focus on actionable insights.

Me: Makes sense. Letâ€™s talk about edge cases. What if some hourly data is missing?

AI: We should provide defaults and instruct the AI to indicate uncertainty. Example: "Data incomplete; advice based on available info." This preserves robustness and user trust.

Me: What about multi-factor conditions? Can we expand beyond just wind or temperature?

AI: Absolutely. For instance, a combination of high heat index + moderate wind might trigger a cautionary note. We can encode these thresholds in the system prompt or operational guidelines.

Me: How can we verify the AI consistently follows these rules?

AI: By running test prompts covering edge casesâ€”winds just above/below thresholds, temps at boundariesâ€”and checking if outputs adhere to high- and low-risk rules. Any deviation informs iterative refinement.

Me: Could we compress data further to save tokens, like using symbolic placeholders for weather descriptions?

AI: Yes. We can map 'Partly Cloudy' â†’ 'PC', 'Rain' â†’ 'R', etc. The LLM then decodes internally. It reduces token usage but requires careful explanation in the system prompt.

Me: And if a user asks something unconventional, like "Is it safe to fly a kite tomorrow?"?

AI: The LLM should map the question to relevant rules (wind + temp + precipitation) and give action-oriented advice. A mapping table in the system prompt helps guide behavior consistently.

Me: Letâ€™s summarize the final function workflow.

AI: Sure. generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data):

Check weather_data: Return a polite fallback if empty.

Summarize key metrics: min/max temps, representative weather descriptions for the next 3 days.

Construct system prompt: Persona + grounding + operational guidelines.

Construct structured user prompt: Labeled data points + user question.

Send messages to LLM: Ask via ask_ollama(messages).

Return AI response: Fully actionable, grounded, and token-efficient.

Me: This approach now accounts for persona, grounding, domain knowledge, token efficiency, edge-case handling, multi-factor rules, and deterministic output.

AI: Correct. It also allows iterative testing, so the system can be refined over time, ensuring consistent, high-quality, actionable advice for the user.

Me: Excellent. I think this conversation fully documents how we transitioned the LLM from a data summarizer to a personalized weather advisor, with all the safeguards, operational rules, and efficiency considerations.


AI: Exactly. This is now a research-informed, production-ready approach for actionable weather guidance using LLMs.
